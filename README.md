Github Repo for Homework 2 as part of the Quintrix Training

Prompt: 
Algorithm question (to be done in Swift)
Get the sub array from fibonacchi sequence starting from input Number and for count number of elements.
eg: if input number is 3, count 2 --> output : [3, 5]
      if input number is 5, count 3 --> output: [5, 8, 13]
      if input number is 4, count 4 --> output: [ ] // empty array because 4 is not part of fibonacchi sequence. 
For Project:
 
Create a similar app that we built in the class. 

Use this api to show posts: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

All the posts should be grouped by the user.

File Structure:
The fibonacci algorithm Swift file can be found in the root directory by itself. Calling Fib() with given input parameters will return desired results

The app project is found under userPostsApp sub-directory. Run the xCode project to see results of build.
